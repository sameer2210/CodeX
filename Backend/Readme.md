# CodeX Backend

## Overview

CodeX is a collaborative AI-powered code editor platform. The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, **Socket.IO** for real-time features, and **OpenAI** for AI code reviews. It supports team-based authentication, real-time code editing, chat, voice/video calls (via WebRTC signaling), and project management.

Key Features:

- **Team-based Auth**: Users join or create teams with unique usernames.
- **Projects**: Create, edit, and review code in real-time with team members.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Chat, code syncing, and WebRTC calls.
- **AI Integration**: Automatic code reviews using GPT-4o.
- **Security**: JWT tokens, rate limiting, CORS, Helmet.

The API is RESTful with `/api` prefix. Real-time uses Socket.IO. Database: MongoDB.

text## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- OpenAI API key (for AI reviews)
- Postman (for API testing; see collection below)

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
Environment Variables
Create .env in Backend/:
textPORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/codex  # Or Atlas URI
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key  # Min 32 chars
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173  # For CORS
Running the Server

Start MongoDB.
Run in dev mode:
bashnpm run dev  # Uses nodemon for auto-restart

Or production:
bashnpm start


Server runs on http://localhost:5000. Health check: GET / returns server status.
Socket.IO connects on the same port for real-time.
Workflow
High-Level Flow

Auth: User registers (creates team + first member) or logs in (joins team). JWT token issued, stored in localStorage (frontend).
Team Management: Fetch members, update activity (auto on login/logout).
Projects: Create/list/update projects (team-scoped). Edit code in real-time via Socket.IO.
Real-time:

Chat: Send/receive messages (persisted in DB, broadcast to team).
Code Editing: Join project room, broadcast changes (deltas/cursor).
Calls: Signal WebRTC offers/answers/ICE via Socket.IO (P2P on frontend).


AI Review: Trigger review on project code; save result to DB.
Security: All protected routes require JWT. Tokens expire in 24h. Rate limiting: 100 req/15min per IP.

Database Flow

Teams: One doc per team (password hashed, members array).
Projects: One doc per project (linked to teamName, stores code/review).
Messages: One doc per message (linked to team/project, timestamped).

Real-time Flow (Socket.IO)

Connect with JWT auth.
Auto-join team room on connect.
Events: Broadcast to team/project rooms.
User mapping: Track socket IDs for targeted calls.

API Routes
All responses: { success: true/false, message: "...", data: {...} }. Errors: 4xx/5xx with message.
Auth Routes (/api/auth)

Auth Routes (/api/auth)

POST /register
Description: Create a new team and add the first admin member. Validates input lengths (teamName >=3, username >=2, password >=6).
Auth Required: No
Body: { teamName: string, username: string, password: string }
POST /login
Description: Authenticate a user and add them as a member if new. Updates lastLogin. Returns JWT token and user details.
Auth Required: No
Body: { teamName: string, username: string, password: string }
GET /verify
Description: Verify the provided JWT and return user info (teamName, username, isAdmin).
Auth Required: Yes (JWT in Authorization header)
Body/Params: None
POST /logout
Description: Set the member's isActive to false (tracks offline status). Client should clear the token locally.
Auth Required: Yes (JWT)
Body/Params: None
GET /team/:teamName/members
Description: Fetch active team members (includes username, isAdmin, lastLogin, joinedAt, isActive).

Services & Controllers

Services: Pure logic (e.g., auth.service.js: hashing/JWT/team ops; project.service.js: CRUD; ai.service.js: OpenAI chat completion).
Controllers: Handle req/res (validation, call services, format responses).

Testing
Use the Postman collection (CodeX_API.postman_collection.json) for API tests:

Set {{BASE_URL}} = http://localhost:5000
After login, copy token to {{JWT_TOKEN}}
Create project, copy _id to {{PROJECT_ID}}

For real-time: Use Socket.IO tester tools or frontend.
Deployment

Heroku/Vercel: Set env vars, use MongoDB Atlas.
PM2: For production: pm2 start server.js
Scaling: Socket.IO supports Redis adapter for multi-instance.
HTTPS: Use for production (CORS/WS).

Troubleshooting

CORS Errors: Check FRONTEND_URL.
JWT Issues: Verify secret/expiration.
Mongo Errors: Ensure URI and connection.
AI Failures: Check OpenAI key; fallback to mock if needed.
Logs: Morgan (combined) for requests; console for sockets.

Contributing
Fork, PR with tests. Lint: ESLint (standard).
For questions: Check code comments or open issue.

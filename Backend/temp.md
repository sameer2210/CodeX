```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 *
 * @param {number} a The first number.
 * @param {number} b The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;
let sum = add(num1, num2);

console.log("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + sum); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15


// Alternatively, you can use arrow function syntax:
const addArrow = (a, b) => a + b;

let num3 = 7;
let num4 = 3;
let sumArrow = addArrow(num3, num4);

console.log("The sum of " + num3 + " and " + num4 + " is: " + sumArrow); // Output: The sum of 7 and 3 is: 10
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Documentation (JSDoc):**  The `/** ... */` block provides documentation using JSDoc syntax. This is crucial for making your co
de understandable, especially for larger projects or when others need to use your function.  It describes the function's purpose, parame
ters, and return value.  This allows tools to automatically generate documentation from your code.
* **Type Hinting (Optional but Recommended):**  The ` @param {number} a` lines specify the expected data type (number) for the parameter
s.  While JavaScript doesn't enforce types directly at runtime (unless using TypeScript),  type hints greatly improve readability and he
lp catch potential errors early through static analysis tools.
* **Return Statement:** The `return a + b;` line is the core of the function, actually performing the addition and returning the result.
  Without this, the function wouldn't produce any output.
* **Example Usage:**  The code includes example usages to show how to call the function and what the output would be. This makes the fun
ction immediately understandable and usable.
* **Arrow Function Syntax:**  Demonstrates the more concise arrow function syntax (`=>`), which is commonly used in modern JavaScript.  
This is functionally equivalent to the regular function definition.
* **Error Handling (For production code, consider this):**  While not strictly necessary for a simple addition function, in a real-world
 application, you might want to add checks to ensure that the inputs `a` and `b` are actually numbers.  You could use `typeof` or `Numbe
r.isNaN()` to validate the inputs and throw an error or return a default value if they are not numbers.  This makes your function more r
obust.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is formatted for maximum readability, using meaningful variable names and consistent indentatio
n.

Here's how you might add basic error handling (in a more complete function for a production environment):

```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers together, with input validation.
 *
 * @param {number} a The first number.
 * @param {number} b The second number.
 * @returns {number | NaN} The sum of the two numbers, or NaN if either input is not a number.
 */
function addSafe(a, b) {
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        console.error("Invalid input: Both arguments must be numbers.");
        return NaN; // Or throw an error: throw new TypeError("Invalid input: Both arguments must be numbers.");
    }

    if (Number.isNaN(a) || Number.isNaN(b)) {
        console.error("Invalid input: Arguments cannot be NaN.");
        return NaN;
    }

    return a + b;
}

let result = addSafe(5, "hello"); // Example of invalid input
console.log(result); // Output: NaN and an error message in the console

result = addSafe(5, 10);
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

This improved version includes input validation, making the function more robust and preventing unexpected behavior.  Choose the version
 that best suits your needs (the simple version for basic use, the safe version for production environments).

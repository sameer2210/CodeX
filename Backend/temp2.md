```javascript
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 *
 * @param {number} a The first number.
 * @param {number} b The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;
let sum = add(num1, num2);

console.log("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + sum); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15

// You can also use it directly:
console.log(add(3, 7)); // Output: 10
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`/** ... */`**:  This is a multi-line comment block, used to document the function.  It explains what the function does, the types
 of the parameters it accepts, and what it returns.  This is good practice for making your code understandable.

2.  **`function add(a, b) { ... }`**: This defines a function named `add`.
    *   `function`:  Keyword to declare a function.
    *   `add`:  The name of the function (you can choose any valid name).
    *   `(a, b)`:  The parameters of the function.  `a` and `b` are variables that will hold the numbers you want to add.  They act as p
laceholders for the actual values.
    *   `{ ... }`:  The function body.  This contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.

3.  **`return a + b;`**: This is the core of the function.
    *   `a + b`:  This performs the addition of the two input numbers (`a` and `b`).
    *   `return`:  This keyword sends the result of the addition back to the part of the code that called the function.  The function st
ops executing after the `return` statement.

4.  **Example Usage:** The comments demonstrate how to use the `add` function.
    *   `let num1 = 5;` and `let num2 = 10;`:  Declare two variables and assign them number values. `let` is used to declare variables t
hat can be reassigned later.
    *   `let sum = add(num1, num2);`:  Calls the `add` function, passing `num1` and `num2` as arguments. The returned value (the sum) is
 then stored in the `sum` variable.
    *   `console.log(...)`:  Prints the result to the console (usually the browser's developer console or the terminal if you're running
 Node.js).

**How it Works:**

When you call `add(num1, num2)`, JavaScript does the following:

1.  The values of `num1` (which is 5) and `num2` (which is 10) are passed into the `add` function as the values of `a` and `b` respectiv
ely.
2.  Inside the `add` function, `a + b` (which is 5 + 10) is calculated, resulting in 15.
3.  The `return` statement sends the value 15 back to the part of the code that called the function.
4.  The value 15 is then assigned to the `sum` variable.
5.  Finally, `console.log` displays the message "The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15" in the console.
